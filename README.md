# Advent Of Code - No Loops
A co-worker told me about the [Advent Of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2024) and I had to do it - too much fun could be had coding random challenges along a theme.
Reading the first puzzle, the coding would be straightforward in my native fingertips - Java. To bring some extra intrigue I decided to do it without loops - meaning
I'd be forced to learn more functional aspects of the language - for better or worse.

# Puzzle Log

## Puzzle 1
The challenge is real. I'll learn to think a bit differently. Also, is using `IntStream.range` too close to a loop - I'll probably have feelings after a few more puzzles. 
Some copy-paste code reuse should be refactored - I'll pass judgement after another puzzle. 

## Puzzle 2
Personal time for this has been limited, but it's _in progress_.
